# üß† Build Rush

Build Rush is a build memorizing minigame for Minecraft!  
The goal is to memorize a structure and then rebuild it as fast as possible.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Although this mod is functional in its current state, it is still very work-in-progress!**

This is a part of an attempt to create an open source Fabric-based minigames server. (Nucleoid)
